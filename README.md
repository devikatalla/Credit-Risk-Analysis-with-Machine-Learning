**Problem Statement**

In todayâ€™s financial landscape, managing credit risk is crucial for maintaining the stability and profitability of financial institutions. Credit risk refers to the likelihood that a borrower may default on a loan, leading to financial losses for the lender. Accurately assessing the risk of default is essential to making informed lending decisions.

This project focuses on Credit Risk Analysis using machine learning techniques to build predictive models that can assess the likelihood of default for a given customer. By leveraging historical data, the model identifies key risk factors and provides insights into customer behaviors and attributes that contribute to higher default risk. The goal of this project is to develop a reliable model that helps financial institutions mitigate potential losses by identifying high-risk customers in advance and making better lending decisions.
